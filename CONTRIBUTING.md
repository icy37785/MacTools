# Contributing to MacTools

<a href="CONTRIBUTING.zh-CN.md">[中文]</a> [English]

Thanks for your interest in MacTools. Please keep each contribution small and clear: explain the problem, provide verifiable changes, and avoid mixing unrelated refactors into the same pull request.

Unless a file is clearly identified as third-party material under separate terms, contributions accepted into MacTools are licensed under `GPL-3.0-only`, consistent with the repository's [licensing policy](LICENSING.md). By submitting a contribution, you confirm that you have the right to provide it under those terms.

## Ways to Contribute
- Bug reports should include reproduction steps, expected behavior, actual behavior, macOS version, and relevant logs or screenshots.
- Feature suggestions should describe the use case, target users, and expected interaction. For large plugins or interaction changes, open an issue first to align on scope.
- Changes involving file deletion, system permissions, global shortcuts, display control, signing, or update flows should explain risks, safeguards, and rollback options.

## Development Environment
- Xcode and `xcodegen` are required. The project supports macOS 14.0 and later.
- First-time setup: run `make setup`, then edit `LocalConfig.xcconfig` and fill in `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` and a stable, non-placeholder `BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER_PREFIX`. Debug builds fail early when either value is missing so macOS cannot register a malformed duplicate app identity.
- Use `make run` for local app testing. It installs the canonical Debug app at `~/Applications/MacTools Dev.app` and unregisters other `MacTools Dev` build copies from LaunchServices.
- Common commands: `make generate` generates the Xcode project, `make build` validates compilation, and `make run` installs the verified Debug bundle at `~/Applications/MacTools Dev.app` before running it locally.
- Plugin development: `make run` incrementally builds the app and plugins, then syncs the latest Debug plugin packages to the local development marketplace. A full sync moves packages absent from the current checkout into the recoverable Debug quarantine; a filtered `PLUGIN=...` sync leaves unrelated packages untouched. `make sync-debug-plugins` only syncs already built plugins. `make build-plugin` is reserved for validating dynamic plugin packages or release flows; to build one plugin, run `make build-plugin PLUGIN=calendar`.
- Do not commit local or generated files: `MacTools.xcodeproj`, `MacTools.xcworkspace`, `LocalConfig.xcconfig`, `build/`, or `scripts/release.local.env`.

## Project Structure
- `Sources/App/`: app entry point, menu bar status item, settings pages, and window routing.
- `Sources/Core/`: shared infrastructure such as the plugin host, dynamic plugin loading, shortcuts, permissions, logging, and updates.
- `Sources/MacToolsPluginKit/`: plugin APIs, declarative UI models, and runtime context.
- `Plugins/<PluginName>/`: plugin manifest, source code, bundle entry point, resources, and adjacent tests.
- `Tests/`: XCTest coverage for shared App/Core logic. Plugin tests should live inside the corresponding plugin directory when possible.
- `project.yml`: root XcodeGen project source, only for the App, PluginKit, and shared aggregate entry points. Plugin targets are generated automatically.
- `Plugins/<PluginName>/project.yml`: optional per-plugin build overrides, only when a plugin needs extra frameworks, include paths, bundle resources, helper/tool targets, or target overrides.
- `docs/plugins/`: plugin packages, catalogs, local debugging, and release flow documentation.
- `docs/icon-gallery/`: checked-in menu-bar icon catalog, previews, animation frames, and archives; rendering-mode rules are documented in `docs/icon-gallery.md`.
- `docs/superpowers/`: larger product, interaction, or implementation design documents.

## Development Guidelines
- Add new plugins under `Plugins/<PluginName>/` with at least `plugin.json`, `Sources/`, and `Bundle/`.
- Ordinary plugins only need to define `plugin.json`, source code, and a bundle entry point. `make generate` scans `Plugins/*/plugin.json` and generates local `Configs/GeneratedPlugins.yml`; do not edit generated files manually.
- Features that require macOS app extensions, such as Finder Sync, must add the extension target to the root `project.yml` and embed it in the main app. Use the dynamic plugin only for the MacTools panel/settings surface.
- Command workflows for adding and updating plugins are documented in the Development Steps section of `docs/plugins/local-native-plugins.md`.
- Keep documentation short and task-focused. User-visible behavior changes should update `README.md` or the relevant file under `docs/`; plugin package, catalog, or release flow changes should update `docs/plugins/`.
- Keep `CHANGELOG.md` as the canonical release history. Do not edit `Sources/Resources/ReleaseHistory.json` by hand; release preparation regenerates it, and `python3 scripts/changelog.py export-history` repairs it after intentional historical edits.
- Icon gallery assets must explicitly declare `renderingMode`; use `template` only for black artwork on transparency, and use `original` for color or grayscale detail. Third-party static assets must pin their upstream revision and catalog mapping in `docs/icon-gallery/sources/manifest.json`, with the corresponding license under `Sources/Resources/ThirdPartyNotices/`. Run the gallery generation and related tests after catalog changes.
- Plugins implement `MacToolsPlugin`; menu panel plugins implement `PluginPrimaryPanel`, and component panel plugins implement `PluginComponentPanel`.
- `plugin.json.id` must be stable, readable, and exactly match the runtime `PluginMetadata.id`; each plugin package should return exactly one plugin instance.
- Plugin display state should be expressed through `PluginPanelState`, `PluginPanelDetail`, `PluginPanelControl`, and related models. Do not bypass the existing panel framework.
- Prefer `PluginSettingsPage.form` with declarative sections and typed controls. Use a custom form section for a complex region and `PluginSettingsPage.workspace` only for task-oriented managers or editors that need the full content area. Permissions, shortcuts, page chrome, search, validation, and backgrounds remain host-owned.
- Publish executable plugin capabilities through stable `PluginActionProviding` definitions. Keep action discovery and execution in the host-owned registry/executor, and keep ordinary global bindings in `ShortcutAssignmentService`; workflows, Run Links, and Action Grid must reference those actions instead of defining parallel command, shortcut, or URL paths. The architecture and automated test matrix are documented in `docs/actions-automation.md`.
- A plugin may implement `PluginActionExposureProviding` to veto a canonical action on a host-owned system surface such as App Intents. Treat `.automatic` as delegation to the host's conservative eligibility policy, never as an allowlist override. Unknown surfaces and provider failures fail closed, and the executor rechecks the live policy immediately before starting the action. Run Link policy remains a separate contract.
- When a plugin adopts an action-surface or other newly exported PluginKit type, set its `plugin.json.minHostVersion` to the first compatible app release. Compatibility metadata belongs in the source manifest. When local plugin validation requires that unreleased host version, `MARKETING_VERSION` may predeclare it; the app release helper treats a source version ahead of the latest app tag as the default release target and remains responsible for advancing `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`. Release tooling owns plugin package version bumps.
- If ordinary plugin resources rarely change, prefer bundling them into the executable. If extra bundle resources are needed, declare the smallest necessary differences in the plugin's own `project.yml`.
- Custom plugin settings views must reuse `MacToolsPluginKit.PluginSettingsTheme` and `.pluginSettingsCardBackground(.standard/.recessed)`. Do not copy private plugin settings styles, and do not make plugins depend on `Sources/App/SettingsStyle.swift`.
- Call `onStateChange?()` after plugin state changes. Long-running scans, file system work, and system calls should not block the main thread for extended periods.
- User-facing copy is primarily Chinese. Keep it concise, clear, and close to native macOS wording.
- Localize user-facing copy with `.xcstrings`. App/Core copy belongs under `Sources/Resources/Localization`, PluginKit copy under `Sources/MacToolsPluginKit/Resources`, and plugin copy under `Plugins/<PluginName>/Resources`. Plugin `plugin.json` files should keep `displayName`/`summary` as fallbacks and add `localizedMetadata` for marketplace and unloaded-plugin presentation. Pre-install product, capability, privacy, setup, and relationship metadata belongs in the same `plugin.json`; follow `docs/plugins/plugin-manifest.schema.json`. Declare localized product copy once under the source-only `productStrings` table, using `@displayName`, `@summary`, `@localizable.<key>`, `@standardAction.<key>`, `@standardSetup.requirements.<key>`, or all 11 locale values, and make every localized product field reference `@productStrings.<key>`. Keep referenced screenshots under `MarketplaceAssets/`, and never add a parallel marketplace manifest or machine-local dynamic action entries.
- Keep current `plugin.json` runtime envelopes complete. Generated package manifests must contain expanded localization values and match their source metadata; do not edit package copies independently. Legacy manifests must still include runtime-decodable `capabilities` and `permissions`; omitting newer product fields is supported only for PluginKit versions below 5 through the explicit local-debug compatibility flag and must never be used for release catalog generation.
- New plugins should provide localization whenever practical, at minimum for panel copy, settings copy, permission text, and plugin metadata.
- Prefer Apple native frameworks. When adding system frameworks, private include paths, or helper executables inside a plugin bundle, declare the smallest necessary differences in the plugin's own `project.yml`. Bundle resource executables that need separate signing should be listed in `plugin.json.package.signPaths`.
- Plugins that use private Apple frameworks must load them dynamically at runtime and validate the required classes and selectors. Do not statically link private frameworks, and surface unsupported-system errors instead of crashing.
- Plugins that intercept pointer events must declare Accessibility permission, stop their event tap on deactivation, and re-enable a tap disabled by macOS.
- Plugins that move or resize windows must use public Accessibility APIs for ordinary position and size writes, revalidate the focused window immediately before writing, calculate against the current display visible frame, and keep pure multi-display geometry independently testable. Capabilities unavailable through Accessibility may use a narrowly scoped, dynamically loaded, version-gated private API after review and must fail closed when unsupported.

## Testing
- Behavioral changes should add or update adjacent XCTest coverage. Test files should be named `<TypeName>Tests.swift`.
- Full test command: `xcodebuild -project MacTools.xcodeproj -scheme MacTools -configuration Debug -derivedDataPath build/DerivedData test -quiet`.
- Single test class: append `-only-testing:MacToolsTests/<TestClassName>` to the full test command.
- File system tests should use temporary directories or fake stores. Disk cleanup tests must not delete real user directories.

## Pull Request Checklist
- Keep the PR focused, and explain the purpose, verification, and user impact.
- Prefer English for commit messages, pull request titles/descriptions, and issues.
- Build or tests have passed. If they could not be run, explain why in the PR.
- User-visible behavior changes are reflected in `README.md` or the relevant design documentation.
- User-visible app or plugin changes include a concise English changelog fragment in `changes/unreleased/*.md`.
- Plugin manifest `capabilities.settings` (`none`, `form`, or `workspace`) matches the runtime `settingsPage` layout.
- Rich manifest static and dynamic action descriptors match the runtime provider/action identity, risk, permissions, external policy, automation eligibility, and parameter portability.
- High-risk features cover safety checks, error states, and missing-permission cases.
- The PR does not include unrelated formatting, generated files, local configuration, certificates, or release credentials.
- New or updated third-party material is recorded in `Sources/Resources/ThirdPartyNotices/manifest.json` with an exact upstream revision, affected products, source paths, and retained license text.

## Release
- Releases are handled by maintainers. Do not create tags, publish GitHub Releases, or commit release artifacts in ordinary contributions.
- For GitHub-based releases, prefer `Actions` -> `Prepare Release`. Enter `type`, target `version`, and whether to `release`; when `release` is enabled, the workflow continues to the actual release workflow after bumping, committing, and creating the tag.
- For quick releases, prefer `make release`. The command interactively chooses `app` or `plugin`, analyzes the next `patch`/`minor`/`major` version, previews the bump, then only after confirmation runs `git pull --rebase`, lightweight checks, version updates, commit, tag creation, and tag push.
- App releases update `MARKETING_VERSION` and `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` in `Configs/AppVersion.xcconfig`. The app and embedded extensions inherit this shared version config. After pushing a `v*.*.*` tag, the `Release` workflow builds, signs, notarizes, uploads the DMG, marks the stable App release as GitHub Latest, and updates the Appcast plus website download metadata.
- Plugin releases push a `plugins-*` batch tag. The default `auto` mode uses the production catalog to find new plugins, already bumped plugins, and package-related plugin changes; it updates `plugin.json.version` when needed, then the `Plugin Release` workflow builds plugins and merges the signed catalog. Plugin batch releases are never marked as GitHub Latest. When a batch raises individual plugins' `minHostVersion`, publish and verify the signed plugin catalog before releasing that host version; the catalog keeps its oldest schema-compatible host floor and older apps leave newer entries unavailable.
- On first launch, a new app version checks installed plugins and automatically updates them from the signed production catalog. It does not normally install plugins the user has not installed. The only exception is a host-declared feature-extraction migration: when an installed source plugin still owns a legacy preference, the host may runtime-validate the replacement package and update the source as one rollback-protected operation. Manually installing that replacement also coordinates retirement of an older source package, even before the legacy preference has been written.
- Non-interactive examples: `make release ARGS="--type app --version 1.0.7 --yes"` or `make release ARGS="--type plugin --version 1.0.10 --plugin-mode selected --plugin calendar --yes"`.
- Add `--dry-run` to preview the steps. The working tree must be clean before a real release.
- Before local release builds, copy `scripts/release.local.env.sample` to `scripts/release.local.env` and fill in at least `DEVELOPER_ID_APPLICATION`.
- If Apple notarization is needed, store credentials first with `xcrun notarytool store-credentials`.
- Version numbers default to `MARKETING_VERSION` and `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` in `Configs/AppVersion.xcconfig`.
- Local production builds can still use the lower-level script: `./scripts/release-local.sh`; before publishing to GitHub Releases, run `gh auth login`, then `./scripts/release-local.sh --publish`.
- Plugin library releases are triggered by `plugins-*` batch tags through the `Plugin Release` workflow. Within one PluginKit ABI and catalog-schema compatibility line, plugins with bumped versions are built and uploaded, then merged into that line's catalog. Changes under `Sources/MacToolsPluginKit/` require rebuilding and bumping every plugin so the catalog cannot retain binaries linked against an older shared framework. The standard `make release` flow performs these manifest bumps in the release commit; feature PRs should not pre-bump unrelated plugins. The first release of a new ABI or schema line also rebuilds every plugin and writes a separate catalog. MacTools through 1.1.6 keeps reading the immutable PluginKit v4 catalog at `docs/plugins/v4/catalog.json`; MacTools 1.2.0 keeps reading PluginKit v5 schema 2 at `docs/plugins/v5/catalog.json`; schema-3 hosts read `docs/plugins/v5/schema3/catalog.json`. Publish the compatible plugin batch and catalog first, wait for Pages to serve the committed signed catalog, and only then prepare or publish the corresponding app. The app release helper and final release workflow fail closed unless that deployed catalog exactly matches the committed catalog and has a valid signature. The catalog private key, Developer ID certificate, and GitHub token must come from CI secrets or local environment variables.
- GitHub Actions build and release configuration is documented in `docs/github-actions.md`; plugin catalog, package structure, and batch release flows are documented in `docs/plugins/plugin-catalog.md`.
