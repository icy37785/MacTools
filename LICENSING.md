# MacTools Licensing

MacTools is distributed under `GPL-3.0-only`, except for files and components that are explicitly identified as third-party material.

The GPL default covers the MacTools application, MacToolsPluginKit, the official plugins maintained in this repository, and project-authored build tooling, documentation, and website source. Each official plugin manifest carries `GPL-3.0-only` as machine-readable product metadata.

## Historical Releases

Published revisions and release artifacts that predate the GPL transition remain available under the license terms that accompanied those revisions, including Apache License 2.0. Existing Apache-2.0 grants are not revoked. A copy of that license is retained at [`LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt`](LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt).

The GPL default applies to release artifacts built from source revisions that contain the GPLv3 root [`LICENSE`](LICENSE). Historical tags, archives, and signed plugin catalogs are not rewritten to describe a different license.

## Third-Party Material

Third-party dependencies, adapted code, and assets retain their original copyright notices and license terms. The canonical inventory is [`Sources/Resources/ThirdPartyNotices/manifest.json`](Sources/Resources/ThirdPartyNotices/manifest.json). The build generates product-specific notices from that inventory, so an application or plugin package receives only the notices relevant to that artifact.

The root GPL license does not relicense separately identified third-party material. Research-only references that are not included or adapted are not distribution components and do not appear in generated notices.

Apple-provided system symbols rendered under `docs/assets/sf-symbols/`, platform screenshots, trademarks, and other third-party visual material are not relicensed under the GPL. Their use remains subject to the applicable platform and rights-holder terms. The GPL license also does not grant trademark rights in the MacTools name or branding.

## Plugins

Official MacTools plugins are distributed under `GPL-3.0-only`. Independently distributed plugin archives receive a generated copy of the root license during release packaging; plugin source directories do not maintain duplicate license files.

Third-party plugins are not automatically relicensed by MacTools. Their manifests must state their own license. Because native MacTools plugins load in process and use MacToolsPluginKit, plugins accepted into the official catalog must use terms compatible with GPLv3 unless a separately documented exception or out-of-process integration model applies.

## Corresponding Source

Release binaries are published from versioned Git tags. The corresponding source, build scripts, dependency lock data, and release instructions are available from the source archive for the matching tag on the MacTools release page.
